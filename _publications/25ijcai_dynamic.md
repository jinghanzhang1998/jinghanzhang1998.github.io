Feature representation defines the space in which data points are vectorized and embedded for model learning.  
The effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms is closely tied to the quality of **feature engineering**, particularly **feature generation**, which transforms raw data into a refined, optimized feature space.

Despite recent progress, existing automated feature generation methods suffer from **limited explainability**, **restricted applicability**, and **inflexible strategy adaptation** across different tasks and data types.

We propose **Dynamic and Adaptive Feature Generation (DAFG)**, which leverages **LLMs** and **feature-generating prompts** to address these challenges.  
Our method adapts dynamically across data modalities and tasks while providing interpretable generation paths and greater flexibility.

Experiments across a variety of datasets demonstrate that DAFG consistently outperforms current methods in both interpretability and downstream performance.
