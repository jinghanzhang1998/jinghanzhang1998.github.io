Accurate **risk assessment** is a critical component in modern financial decision-making.  
While **Transformer-based models** have achieved strong performance in time-series forecasting, they often fail to capture **extreme risk conditions**, leading to underestimation of rare but impactful financial losses.

We propose **Loss-at-Risk (LaR)**, a new loss function that integrates **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)** into Transformer architectures.  
This design enhances the modelâ€™s awareness of potential extreme losses and improves robustness under volatile market conditions.

Empirical evaluations across multiple financial datasets show that incorporating LaR into Transformers significantly improves **risk sensitivity**, **forecast reliability**, and **tail-risk management** compared to conventional objectives such as MSE or MAE.
