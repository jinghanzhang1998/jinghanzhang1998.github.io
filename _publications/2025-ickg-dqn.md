**Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** has demonstrated strong potential in solving complex sequential decision-making tasks.  
However, conventional models often rely on **static training regimes** and perform poorly under dynamically changing environments.

We propose **IDEM-DQN (Interactive Dynamic Evaluation Method for DQN)**, a novel framework that incorporates **dynamic weight adjustment** mechanisms into **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** to enhance adaptability.  
By modifying **experience replay sampling probabilities** based on **real-time feedback** and **environmental metrics**, IDEM-DQN focuses learning on the most critical transitions.

This dynamic reweighting strategy allows the model to **respond efficiently to environmental shifts** and maintain robust performance even under rapid or unpredictable changes.  
Extensive experiments show that IDEM-DQN outperforms standard DQN and its variants in real-time adaptability and convergence stability.
