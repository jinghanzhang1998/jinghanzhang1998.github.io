I am **Jinghan Zhang**, a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Clemson University** (2025–present), advised by [Dr. Kunpeng Liu](https://www.kunpengliu.com/) in the **CLAIM Lab**.  

My research centers on large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), and agentic systems. I am particularly interested in developing data-efficient and robust reasoning mechanisms that enable large models to perform coherent, verifiable, and interpretable inference. My future work aims to enhance the interpretability and stability of reasoning in large models and agentic systems, paving the way toward more trustworthy, controllable, and explainable AI agents.
I am also passionate about applying AI to special education and vocational education, exploring how intelligent systems can make learning and career development more accessible and personalized.

I welcome collaboration and interdisciplinary exchange across fields that share the vision of advancing reasoning and intelligence for human-centered AI. Feel free to contact me!
