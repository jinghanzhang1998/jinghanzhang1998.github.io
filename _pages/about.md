I am **Jinghan Zhang**, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Clemson University** (2025â€“present), advised by [Dr. Kunpeng Liu](https://www.kunpengliu.com/) in the **CLAIM Lab**.  

My research focuses on **large language model reasoning**, **alignment**, and **data-centric reinforcement learning**.  
Previously, I studied at **Portland State University** on reasoning optimization and retrieval-augmented generation.  
I have also interned at **Accenture** as an AI/ML Computational Science Associate Manager, focusing on reinforcement learning and reasoning stability of LLMs.  

My work has appeared in **ACL**, **AAAI**, **IJCAI**, and **IEEE BigData**, covering topics such as data-efficient RLHF, entropy-based reasoning exploration, and feature generation with LLMs.
